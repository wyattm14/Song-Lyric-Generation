I think I'll let you down (Let you down)
Leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I've told you before, oh

But if they'd seen
You're talking that way they'd laugh in my face


So please listen to me, if you wanna stay mine
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I've told you before, oh
You can't do that, oh


(You can't do that
You can't do that
You can't do that

This way


Whoa-I, whoa-I
I've got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home, yeah

When I get home


You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinking of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today


You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today


Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough


To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say

Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today


I've got every reason on earth to be mad
Cos I've just lost the only girl I had
And if I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't so I cry instead


I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
And if I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't so I cry instead


Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay
But I'll come back again someday


And when I do you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead

If it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything my friend
If it makes you feel alright
'Cause I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me


Well, I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad?
All I do is hang my head and moan


Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me

'Cause I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you


Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me


I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her


She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her


A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me


Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her


Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky

Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me


I don't want to kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
Cos I'm happy just to dance with you


I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
Cos I'm happy just to dance with you


Just to dance with you
It's everything I need
Before this dance is through

Cos I'm happy just to dance with you


If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands


If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her


If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain


So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain


So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you


I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do


Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see


That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too


So I should have realized a lot of things before
If this is love you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more


Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Whooh)
When I saw her standing there


Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room

Who never used to cry
The world is treating me bad... Misery!


I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's gonna be a drag... Misery!

Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one


Send her back to me
Cos everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you


There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you


Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew


There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you


Then there was music and wonderful roses

Well gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local D.J.
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today


You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart beating rhythm
While my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news


I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I caught it off the writer
Sittin' down by the rhythm reviews
Roll over Beethoven
We're rockin' in two by two


Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just triffle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
A rocking in two by two - Ooo


Well early in the morning
I'm a giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news


You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see them reel an rock
Long as she's got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues
