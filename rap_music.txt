The winner takes all
It's the thrill of one more kill
The last one to fall
Will never sacrifice their willDon't ever look back on the world closing in
Be on the attack with your wings on the wind
Oh, the games will begin
Sweet, sweet, sweet victory... yeahIt's ours for the takingIt's ours for the fight
Sweet, sweet, sweet victory... yeah
And the one who's last to fallThe winner takes all
You don't win no silver

You only lose the gold
You push with a fever
For your time keeps tolling on
Against all the odds, against all your pain
Your back's on the wall with no one to blame
Wild hearts won't be tamed
Sweet, sweet, sweet victory... yeah
It's ours for the taking
It's ours for the fight
Sweet, sweet, sweet victory... yeah
And the one who's last to fall
The winner takes all
And the one who's last to fall
Sweet, sweet, sweet victory... yeah
It's ours for the taking
It's ours for the fight
Sweet, sweet, sweet victory... yeah
And the one who's last to fall
The winner takes all

Gary, now I know I was wrong
I messed up, and now you're goneGary, I'm sorry I neglected you
Oh, I never expected you to run away and leave me
Feeling this empty
Your meow right now would sound like music to me
Please come home, 'cause I miss you, Gary(Gary come home...)
Gary come home
(Gary come home...)Gary, can't you see I was blind
I'll do anything to change your mindMore than a pet, you're my best friend
Too cool to forget, come back
'Cause we are family
And forgive me for making you wanna roamAnd now my heart is beating like the saddest metronome
Somewhere I hope you're reading my latest three-word
poem: Gary come home



(Gary come home...)
Gary come home
(Gary come home...)
Gary come home
(Gary come home...)
Gary come home
(Gary come home)
Ahh...
Gary, come home
Gary, come home
